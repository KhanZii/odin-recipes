        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>One of my favorite parts of hibachi is the fried rice and I was determined 
            to make it at home. This recipe is quick and easy and is sure to be a big hit. 
            I enjoy using left-over teriyaki chicken in my fried rice, but you can use any meat you want or no meat at all! 
            With or without chicken it is equally as delicious and a great side dish! You can use more or less garlic, depending on your personal preference.</p>
          <p>Best hibachi recipe ever and rivals that of legitmate hibachi steakhouses. Will leave you coming back for more.</p>
